BREAKDOWN PREDICTION
With the ever-increasing installation capacity of wind power, how to reduce the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs has become a growing challenge for wind farms. O&M costs account for approximately 10–15% and 20–25% of the overall energy generation cost for onshore and offshore wind power plants, respectively. In particular, wind turbine downtime significantly reduces the reliability of wind power and increases O&M costs. Condition monitoring systems (CMSs) that provide predictive maintenance have been developed and deployed in wind farms to help improve wind turbine reliability and reduce O&M costs. Using CMSs, the faults of the major wind turbine components can be predicted in the early stages to prevent further fault escalation. In addition, when failures occur, CMSs can perform an on-the-fly fault diagnosis to identify the specific failure type and help reduce the repair time and cost.

This model predicts the breakdown of a Wind Turbine with 80% accuracy. It has been tested for one year SCADA-Supervisory control and Data acquisition data on a particular Wind Turbine.

Two graphs have been displayed 
MID YEAR PREDICTION 
It predicts the breakdown for high wind period. As it is observed it is very accurate for MID year period.

YEAR EDGE PREDICTION
It predicts the breakdown for low wind period. As it is observed it is very accurate for YEAR EDGE period.
